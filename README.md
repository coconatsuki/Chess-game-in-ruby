# Chess-game-in-ruby

This game was the most challenging of all, and it was the final project of the Ruby chapter.
I had to gather in one game everything I learnt previously.

There's no IA here. It's a 2 real players game.

I had to be very organized and careful about keeping my classes modular and clean,
and limiting my methods to do only one thing each.

I also had to think a lot about how to respect all the Chess rules (especially for the different moves patterns).

The most useful thing I learnt with this project was the Matrix building :
it helped me a lot to make a grill, find the pieces in lines or diagonals, and to move them.
